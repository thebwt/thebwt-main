# Howdy!

My name is Brandon Tomlinson, I'm a Linux Systems Engineer over at Rackspace.

## Profile things

* Github link - My personal github account. Mainly docker stuff, some python in there too.
* Linkedin link - My Linkedin profile, because resumes are passe.
* Twitter Link - Because Trendy?
* Fourth link - Because I am just trying to match the default mkdocks bullet points, and personally challenged to find 4 links that pertain to myself...

## About Me
Because Do I really need to put that on different page?

So life story I guess?
